                    <p> <!-- This paragraph is going to the about what a PCN is, why you did it, and how this event is your roots -->
                        A Pilipinx Culture Night (PCN) is usually hosted by Pilipinx and Pilipinx-American
                        collegiate organizations in order to celebrate and showcase different aspects of
                        the Philippine culture in different ways. For Pagkakaisa, the longest established
                        Pilipinx and Pilipinx-American collegiate organization in San Diego, they wanted to
                        pay homage to the format of one of the earliest PCNs in the nation, which is similar
                        to a talent show while keeping the more modern aspect of a PCN that include Philippine
                        cultural dances. The club president asked me to do the cover art for Pagkakaisa's
                        most recent PCN!<br>
                        
                        <br>

                        The theme for this year's Gising Na PCN is Under One Umbrella, where while members of the
                        Pilipinx and Pilipinx-American community may occupy and actualize different niches of the
                        culture, whether being part of an indigenous tribe, only speaking a Philippine language,
                        not knowing anything, and everything else in between, we are all still under one umbrella
                        of the label "Pilipinx". Apart from designing the cover art, this event was the very first
                        time I did a solo community performance in the form of a VAMP, or a Visual/Audio Monologue
                        Performance. My performance was focused on how I started to become a lot more involved
                        with the community. The best part of the performance was the fact that I had the opportunity
                        to share my experience with my friends who I can consider my siblings!<br>
                            
                        <br>

                        The even greater aspect of the performance is that it helped me realize that I have come
                        full circle. Last year, I was the Vice President of the organization and I was also the
                        Cultural Coordinator, which means that I was the head coordinator of Pagkakaisa Gising Na
                        PCN 2016. In 2015, it was more of a theatrical production, and Gising Na PCN was held in
                        the Joan Kroc Theatre, and I was holding the role of several extras. In all three years,
                        I am a cultural dancer in the Mindanao and Rural/Countryside Suites!<br>
           
                        <br>

                        Fun Fact: I also designed the cover art for Gising Na PCN 2016!
