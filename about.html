                        My name is Monique Arao Garcia and most of my friends call me "Momo".
                        I immigrated here from the Philippines with my family in 2002, when we landed here
                        the day I turned six years old. Ever since I moved here, I naturally gravitated
                        towards computers and technology in general, and my first step to this was through
                        Neopets!

                        <br>
                        
                        I am double majoring in Computer Science and Web Development, but I'm thinking about
                        majoring in Web Development solely, because it combines Computer Science with my
                        love for Graphic Design. I have been doing some freelance graphic design ever since
                        my sophomore year of high school, and I did this more intensively in the last school
                        year, when I was the Graphic Designer for the Associated Student Organization (ASO).
                        In this job, I worked on flyers for events that the ASO hosted, as well as Snapchat
                        Geofilters.
